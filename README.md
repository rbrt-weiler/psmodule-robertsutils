# PowerShell Module: Roberts Utils

A [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) module that contains various functions that [I, Robert](https://robert.weiler.one/), created for my personal use. Currently **in development** and not yet stable.

## Installation

Copy or link the directories contained in this repository somewhere in your `$env:PSModulePath`.

## Functions

The module exports the following functions:

- `Update-GitRepository`
- `Update-GitRepositories`

All exported functions come with an associated help; `Get-Help <FunctionName>` is your friend for now.
